    <p>Xbox Series X and Series S (collectively, the Xbox Series X/S[a]) are upcoming home video game consoles developed by Microsoft. They are both scheduled to be released on November 10, 2020 as the fourth generation of the Xbox console family, succeeding Xbox One.

Rumors regarding the consoles first emerged in early 2019, with the line as a whole codenamed "Scarlett", and consisting of high-end and low-end models codenamed "Anaconda" and "Lockhart" respectively. The high-end model was first teased during E3 2019 under the title "Project Scarlett", while its name and design as Xbox Series X was unveiled during The Game Awards later in December. In September 2020, Microsoft unveiled the low-end model as Xbox Series S.

Microsoft is prioritizing hardware performance, including support for higher display resolutions (up to 8K resolution) along with frame rates, real-time ray tracing, and use of high-speed solid-state drive to reduce loading times, on the Xbox Series X. The Xbox Series S uses the same CPU and reduced GPU, memory, and internal storage and lacks an optical drive.

Microsoft is promoting a gamer-centric approach to their new hardware, including free upgrades which are enhanced versions of Xbox One games via their "Smart Delivery" initiative, games optimized for the Series X hardware, and backward compatibility with previous generation Xbox games, controllers and accessories. The console will also take advantage of their game subscription service Xbox Game Pass, as well as remote cloud gaming on mobile devices via their cloud game-streaming platform xCloud.</p>
